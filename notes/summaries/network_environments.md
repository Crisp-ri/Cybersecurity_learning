# Network Environments - TL;DR

**What**: Modern network designs that separate control, management, and data functions to improve scalability, automation, and security.  
**Why it matters**: Enables cloud-ready, flexible, and secure infrastructures.

---
## Software Defined Networking (SDN)
- Separates **data**, **control**, and **management** planes.  
- Centralized control via controllers and APIs.  
- Cloud-friendly and scalable across devices.

---
## SD-WAN
- SDN applied to **Wide Area Networks**.  
- Application-aware and transport-agnostic (fiber, DSL, 5G).  
- Zero-touch provisioning and centralized policy control.

---
## Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN)
- Overcomes VLAN limit (~4,000) with 16M+ virtual networks.  
- Encapsulates Layer 2 traffic over Layer 3.  
- Enables scalable, multi-datacenter virtualization.

---
## Zero Trust
- "Never trust, always verify."  
- Continuous authentication and least-privilege access.  
- Adaptive, policy-based identity and authorization.  
- Foundation for Secure Access Service Edge (SASE).

---
## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Define infrastructure with code for consistent builds.  
- Version-controlled and automated deployments.  
- Supports dynamic inventories and compliance enforcement.
