# Network Devices

**What**: Hardware used to connect, manage, and route traffic in a network (switches, routers, hubs, access points).  
**Why it matters**: These devices control traffic flow, improve network performance, and ensure communication between devices locally and globally.

## Devices

- **Router** - routes traffic between IP subnets (Network layer).
- **Switch** - forwards traffic based on MAC address (Data Link layer).
- **Firewalls** - filters traffic by port number (TPC/UDP) or application (Transport layer).
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System) and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** - watch network traffic and alert or block intrusions.
- **Load balancer** - distributes the load and is transparent to the end-users. Also fault tolerance.
- **Access point** - extends the wired network to the wireless clients (Data Link layer).
